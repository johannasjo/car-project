# CarProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.1.

## How to

Run npm install in the root of the project to get all the niceties like bootstrap. To start the project run
`ng serve` and then you can access it at: `http://localhost:4200/`

To build the project you run:
`ng build`

I have added the prettier and lint settings for vs code in the repo in case you'd like to take a look
